### Forthcoming in *Organization & Environment* [Special Issue on Social Movements and Private Environmental Governance](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1086026619853783). Download the paper [here](https://github.com/judgelord/FSC-SFI/raw/master/certification.pdf).

**Abstract**

Due to inconsistent measures of regulatory stringency, scholars offer conflicting accounts about whether competing private governance initiatives “race to the bottom,” “ratchet up,” “converge,” or “diverge.” To remedy this, we offer a framework to distinguish three often-conflated measures: regulatory scope, prescriptiveness, and performance levels. We use our framework to compare competing U.S. forestry certification programs, one founded by environmental activists and their allies, the other by the American Forest & Paper Association. We find “upward” but also divergent policy prescriptiveness, with the activist-founded program adding requirements that impose costs on firms and the industry-backed program mostly adding requirements with net benefits to the sector. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that industry-backed programs emphasize less costly types of stringency than activist-backed programs. Furthermore, we find several more nuanced patterns of change that previous scholarship failed to anticipate, illustrating how disentangling types of stringency can improve theory building and testing.

## Context: Regulating foresty in the U.S.

Competing certification regimes, the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) and The Sustainable Forestry Initiative (SFI), play a major role in regulating the forestry industry in the United States, regulating a third of commercially harvested timberland including most corporate-owned timberland.

## Comparing Forest Certification Programs

We compare each program's stringency on 48 key social and environmental issues. For example, the FSC and SFI have different limits on the size of clearcuts and harvesting buffers around streams.

In addition to issue-by-issue comparisons, we use two measures of regulatory stringency that can be aggregated across issues: the scope of issues addressed and the prescriptiveness of requirements on each issue. 

### Types of Stringency
![](Figs/table2.png)

### Policy Prescriptiveness

|  | Discretionary |  Non-discretionary | 
|:----|:----:|:----:|
| Procedural (plan- or systems-based) | Flexible | Somewhat prescriptive | 
| Substantive (e.g.  a policy threshold) | Flexible | Most prescriptive |

The bottom panel of the above figure shows the trend in absolute prescriptiveness. Comparing the total number of increases in prescriptiveness is one way to measure rates of change. By this measure, the FSC-US increased stringency at a faster rate than the SFI from 2008 to 2016.

Overall, each program had distinct areas in which its requirements were more prescriptive. For the FSC, these requirements tended to demand that forest operations “resemble natural processes” and “maintain ecosystem function.” This language appeared more frequently and forcefully in the 2010 standard concerning issues including clearcutting, riparian management, HCVFs, protected areas, old-growth forests, snags and downed wood, residual trees, genetic diversity, plantations, restoration, natural disturbance, non-timber forest products, soil protection, road building, and management planning. In contrast, the SFI was most prescriptive on issues such as material utilization, research, training, education, and public reporting and consultation.  The eight key issues on which the SFI increased prescriptiveness in 2010 also reflect the SFI’s focus on industry capacity and reputation. These included aesthetics, public reporting, education, training, and utilization.

```


Overall, while the PEFC added more requirements concerning indigenous rights and labor standards and came to cover a similar scope of issues to the FSC P&C, the FSC-P&C remained more prescriptive on social issues and significantly more prescriptive on ecological issues. Compared to the prescriptiveness of the FSC-US and SFI described below, the FSC–P&C and PEFC requirements exhibited more convergence on both scope and prescriptiveness, though many differences in policy settings remained.

In most years between 2008 and 2016, neither the FSC nor the SFI changed on any issue (the center cell in the above tables, “equilibrium”).

When they did change, upwardly diverging prescriptiveness was the dominant pattern. Most changes for both programs occurred in 2010 where the overall pattern was divergence, rather than convergence or stability. For all sixteen issues on which only the FSC-US added requirements, it already had the more prescriptive requirements, and almost all of these additions address ecological problems. Similarly, for three out of the four issues on which only the SFI added requirements, the SFI already had more prescriptive requirements. 

The vast majority of changes (twenty-one of twenty-seven issues changed) fit a pattern where one program increased prescriptiveness while the other did not (or in one case, increased to a lesser degree) and the program that increased stringency already had the more prescriptive requirements. On eighteen issues, the less prescriptive program stayed the same, leading to upward divergence. On three issues, the less prescriptive program decreased prescriptiveness, leading to opposing divergence.

Convergence was rare. In 2010, upward convergence only occurred where FSC-US added requirements on the issue of “continual improvement” of harvesting operations, an issue usually associated more with the SFI. This outcome is interesting because scholars generally predict that less stringent private regulations will converge toward “benchmark” standards like FSC’s. Instead, we find the FSC-US ratcheting up prescriptiveness on an issue where its industry-backed competitor had more stringent requirements. Indeed, most studies overlook the possibility that industry-backed standards like the SFI may be more stringent on some issues and thus fail to theorize about dynamics that could cause this. We see downward convergence only on the issues of "community benefits" and "tenure rights," where the more prescriptive FSC-US removed requirements, thus moving closer to SFI. 

Parallel change was also rare. An upward parallel change occurred on only three issues in 2010: forest management planning, controlling carbon emissions, and reporting and consultation, where both programs added requirements. We classify the addition of protections for riparian zones by both SFI and FSC-US as another case of upward divergence rather than upward parallel change because the requirements for riparian protection added by the FSC-US were more prescriptive than those added by the SFI. No issues exhibited downward parallel change, as “race to the bottom” theory anticipates.

After the significant revisions of both programs in 2010, only the SFI updated its requirements, mostly in 2015. In contrast to the 2010 changes, the pattern in 2015 was a moderate upward convergence. SFI increased prescriptiveness on three issues where it did not already have the most prescriptive requirements. While a much smaller scale of change than 2010, this upward convergence is notable because it focuses on regulating toxic chemicals, plantations, and harvesting on tribal lands, which likely have net costs rather than benefits for the industry.

## Conclusion

Scholars have made substantial progress in developing theories of how economic and political forces shape the substance of private regulations, and how these different requirements then affect levels of adoption and compliance. We have argued that testing these theories requires more precise statements of the types of policy substance to which they apply and research that measures change across programs and over time. Our framework for measuring regulatory stringency, and for using longitudinal data to classify patterns of change, offers a foundation for further research about how competing regulatory programs compare, how they evolve, and why. There is no perfect way to compare incommensurate policies. We have nonetheless made our best effort to offer a method to do so. By applying this method, we have systematically quantified differences that can be quantified and described as richly as possible those comparisons that one can only make qualitatively.

Through the case of forestry standards in the U.S., we show what can be gained by careful measurement of regulatory stringency and policy change across a comprehensive scope of issues in a specific domain. Our results show different patterns depending on whether one looks at policy scope, prescriptiveness, or specific policy settings. Careful measurement uncovered trends that previous scholarship has missed and which contradict the predictions of several dominant theories. It also reveals that apparent empirical debates in the literature are the result of research design choices. Some scholars chose a few key issues and found convergence. Others looked broadly and did not see it. We have looked both precisely and broadly and found both conclusions were correct but incomplete. Activist-backed and industry-backed programs converged in policy scope on a few issues, but overall, their scopes have seen little change. Furthermore, we found these programs to have diverged overall on prescriptiveness, because, while both standards “ratcheted up,” they did so at different rates and on different policy issues. We hope that this deep dive into defining regulatory stringency and policy change in one domain not only enables scholarship on the causes of public and private regulation in forestry but that it also offers a model for similar research in other policy domains. 

This approach also has practical value. First, the power dynamics among groups that promote programs like the FSC or the SFI have created an environment in which competing claims about what exactly each program requires and how this has changed confuse buyers. The politics of private regulation revolve around debates over which standards are higher. We offer concepts to clarify what “higher” standards may mean. Second, it is impossible to measure the impact of a set of regulatory requirements without disentangling their component parts. Thus, our analysis of written requirements is a necessary first step for efforts to assess the effects on the ground.

Most importantly, our framework and analysis offer a model for careful measurement of policy change as a variable. It is tempting to take shortcuts by making broad generalizations or by selecting what is easy to measure or what others have highlighted. However, if we aim to build testable theories or collect the kinds of evidence needed to test existing theories, our study illustrates the benefits of defining policy change in ways that can be applied across programs and over time. Doing so will not only improve the quality of research and theory, it may also uncover entirely new puzzles and insights.
