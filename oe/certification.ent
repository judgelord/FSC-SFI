macro:->While
assessing
a
comprehensive
set
of
issues
reduces
the
risk
of
omitting
key
issues
on
which
regulations
may
vary,
it
is
often
time
consuming
and
costly.
Scholars
may
thus
opt
for
a
limited
scope,
as
long
as
they
clearly
describe
their
scope
relative
to
the
potential
set
of
comparisons.
A
comprehensive
approach
is
necessary,
however,
to
assess
claims
about
the
scope
of
regulations
(such
as
the
hypotheses
from
section
2.3).

macro:->While
our
framework
clarifies
differences
in
actual
stringency
between
activist-
and
industry-
backed
programs,
which
program
one
prefers
will
still
depend
on
one's
problem
definitions
and
values.
What
we
do
know
is
that,
on
many
issues,
industry-backed
programs
address
the
same
issues
as
activist-backed
programs
with
language
that
might
give
the
impression
of
equivalence
in
stringency
but
contain
substantially
fewer
prescriptive
requirements.
We
show
that
seemingly
similar
looking
language
requires
very
different
levels
of
performance.
For
example,
the
SFI
requirements
for
``Forests
of
Exceptional
Conservation
Value''
(FECV)
are
much
less
prescriptive
than
the
FSC-US
requirements
for
``High
Conservation
Value
Forests''
(HCVF),
despite
their
similar
language
(also
see
(e.g.~Figures
\ref
{riparian}
and
\ref
{clearcuts}
and
Table
\ref
{issues}).
The
extent
to
which
this
helps
firms
coordinate
to
maximize
the
impression
of
stringency
while
minimizing
the
costs
of
doing
so
is
a
question
for
future
research.
