                   have recently emerged to address environmental issues
                   in the forest products industry and labor issues in
                   the apparel industry. To explain why the same
                   regulatory form has emerged across these fields, the
                   author uses a historical and comparative case study
                   approach, closely examining early moments and paying
                   attention to " roads not taken. " Two types of
                   factors led to the initial emergence of private
                   certification: (1) social movement campaigns
                   targeting companies and (2) a neo-liberal
                   institutional context. The analysis shows specific
                   ways in which these factors led states,
                   nongovernmental organizations, and companies to build
                   or support certification associations. Recent decades
                   have seen dramatic shifts in the regulation of
                   industries away from traditional " command and
                   control " strategies—based on fixed standards
                   enforced by the state—and toward regulatory forms
                   based on different social con-trol strategies—like
                   market mechanisms, the provision of information, and},

  abstract =      {For Marx, commodity fetishism is the tendency of
                   people to see the product of their labor in terms of
                   relationships between things, rather than social
                   relationships between people. In other words, people
                   viewthe commodity only in terms of the
                   characteristics of the final product while the
                   process through which it was created remains obscured
                   and, therefore, unconsidered. This has crucial
                   implications for our collective ability to see and
                   address the ongoing processes of social and

                   social and environmental relations of production and
                   exchange that lie behind the commodity. This assists
                   producers in making a shift in the qualitative nature
                   of production, particularly in terms of its impacts
                   on producers and on the environment. The purpose of

                   certification of fisheries and aquaculture has
                   provided new forms of governance in sectors that were
                   traditionally dominated by state based regulation.
                   Emerging market based approaches are driven by
                   shareholder expectations as well as commitment to
                   corporate social responsibility, whereas community
                   engagement is increasingly centered on the questions
                   of social license to operate. Third party assessment
                   and certification links state, market and community
                   into an interesting and challenging hybrid form of
                   governance. While civil society organizations have
                   long been active in pursuing sustainable and safe
                   seafood production, the development of formal
                   non-state based certification provides both
                   opportunities and challenges, and opens up
                   interesting debates over hybrid forms of governance.
                   This paper explores these developments in coastal
                   marine resources management, focusing on aquaculture
                   and the development and operation of the Aquaculture
                   Stewardship Council. It examines the case of salmonid
                   aquaculture in Tasmania, Australia, now Australia's
                   most valuable seafood industry, which remains the
                   focus of considerable community debate over its
                   siting, operation and environmental impact.},

                   nongovernmental organizations have created
                   non–state market–driven (NSMD) governance systems
                   whose purpose is to develop and implement
                   environmentally and socially responsible management
                   practices. Eschewing traditional state authority,
                   these systems and their supporters have turned to the
                   market's supply chain to create incentives and force
                   companies to comply. This paper develops an
                   analytical framework designed to understand better
                   the emergence of NSMD governance systems and the
                   conditions under which they may gain authority to
                   create policy. Its theoretical roots draw on
                   pragmatic, moral, and cognitive legitimacy granting
                   distinctions made within organizational sociology,
                   while its empirical focus is on the case of
                   sustainable forestry certification, arguably the most
                   advanced case of NSMD governance globally. The paper
                   argues that such a framework is needed to assess
                   whether these new private governance systems might
                   ultimately challenge existing state–centered
                   authority and public policy–making processes, and

                   to conventional views on the extent and scope of
                   globalization as well as to predictions of the
                   imminent disappearance of the nation state's leverage
                   over the economy. How does globalization change
                   national economies and politics? Are rising levels of
                   trade, capital flows, new communication technologies,
                   and deregulation forcing all societies to converge
                   toward the same structures of production and
                   distribution? Suzanne Berger and Ronald Dore have
                   brought together a distinguished group of experts to
                   consider how the international economy shapes and
                   transforms domestic structures. Drawing from
                   experience in the United States, Europe, and Asia,
                   the contributors ask whether competition, imitation,
                   diffusion of best practice, trade, and financial
                   flows are reducing national diversities. The authors
                   seek to understand whether the sources of national
                   political autonomy are undermined by changes in the
                   international system. Can distinctive varieties of
                   capitalism that incorporate unique and valued

                   scholarly debate about welfare state retrenchment has
                   emerged. One of the debated issues has been the
                   ''dependent variable problem'': what is welfare state
                   retrenchment and how can it be measured. In
                   particular the pros and cons of different types of
                   data have been discussed. The argument of this
                   article is that the ''dependent variable problem'' is
                   a problem of theoretical conceptualization rather
                   than a problem of data. It is crucial to be aware
                   that different theoretical perspectives on
                   retrenchment should lead to different
                   conceptualizations of retrenchment. Furthermore,
                   different conceptualizations lead to different
                   evaluations of the same changes in welfare schemes,
                   just as the question of which data to use depends
                   very much on the theoretical conceptualization of
                   retrenchment.},

  abstract =      {a b s t r a c t The root of the word certification is
                   ''to make certain''. Yet the complex technical and
                   normative chal-lenges certification aims to address,
                   and its engagement of diverse and distant actors, are
                   more about trust than certainty. The reliance on
                   trust is perhaps most evident in ''ethical''
                   certification schemes due to the contested normative
                   and affective nature of their environmental and
                   social claims. Yet there is little research on the
                   dynamics of local to global trust in these schemes.
                   Social scientists have instead focused on the
                   ''legitimacy'' of certification as an authoritative
                   governance mechanism. This discourse has reinforced
                   general trends towards structural formalization and
                   rationalistic control that fail to address underlying
                   sources of distrust. This paper draws on a case study
                   of Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) certification in
                   British Columbia to examine how trust and distrust in
                   certifiers influences the legitimacy and power
                   dynamics of ethical certification, and its ability to
                   promote desired outcomes. It observes how a global,
                   rationalistic system for accrediting certifiers
                   failed to build trust among core local supporters.
                   Instead, normative and affec-tive distrust in
                   certifiers drove the development of prescriptive
                   standards designed to control even the most
                   distrusted certifiers and producers. The result has
                   been slow growth in certified area relative to
                   industry-backed competitor schemes and the
                   demotivation of producers who might otherwise be
                   willing to commit to desired outcomes. The current
                   strategy to build global legitimacy through
                   increasingly for-malized and rationalistic certifier
                   accreditation systems runs counter to the development
                   of local trust in certifiers and the creation of
                   shared values and commitment to good forestry.},

  abstract =      {In countries marked by the growing uptake of
                   non-state market driven (NSMD) governance for
                   agricultural commodities (i.e., eco-labels and
                   certification systems), forested areas are steadily
                   declining while crop lands are growing. Deforestation
                   continues despite NSMD rules strictly prohibiting the
                   conversion of forested land to agriculture. In this
                   paper, we ask why the growing presence of NSMD
                   governance has coincided with ongoing deforestation.
                   While the seeming inability of NSMD governance to
                   halt broader patterns of land use change can be
                   partially explained by a lack of market uptake, there
                   are also a range of other variables that may
                   contribute to this relationship. We probe five
                   hypotheses through comparative case studies of
                   sustainable soy certification in Brazil, palm oil in
                   Indonesia, and cocoa in C{\^{o}}te d'Ivoire. Our
                   plausibility probe indicates that NSMD governance has
                   neither abetted, nor hindered, the conversion of
                   forested land to agricultural production. We find
                   strong evidence that a lack of broad market uptake
                   limits the effectiveness of NSMD governance. However,
                   we also find evidence that regulatory loopholes in
                   NSMD systems may explain the inability of eco-labels
                   and certification systems to halt broader patterns of
                   land use change in countries with comparatively
                   strong market uptake. Our results highlight critical
                   problems related to expanding the reach and
                   stringency of NSMD governance alongside ongoing
                   fragmentation of global environmental governance. The
                   study contributes to scholarship on the impact and
                   effectiveness of transnational environmental

                   more likely to be environmentally beneficial.},

  abstract =      {Why have systems of “transnational private
                   regulation” recently emerged to certify corporate
                   social and environmental performance? Different
                   conceptions of institutional emergence underlie
                   different answers to this question. Many scholars
                   argue that firms create certification systems to
                   solve problems in the market—a view rooted in a
                   conception of institutions as solutions to collective
                   action prob- lems. The author develops a different
                   account by viewing institu- tions as the outcome of
                   political contestation and by analyzing con- flict
                   and institutional entrepreneurship among a wide array
                   of actors. Using a comparative case study design, the
                   analysis shows how these arguments explain the
                   formation of social and environmental cer- tification
                   associations. Both theoretical approaches are needed,
                   but strong versions of the market-based approach
                   overlook an important set of dynamics that the author
                   calls the “political construction of market
                   institutions.” The analysis shows how both problem
                   solving in markets and political contention generate
                   new institutional forms.},

                   bring about uniformity via formalized standards fail.
                   To understand better how such rules successfully span
                   national and organizational boundaries over time, we

                   Long-lasting standardization processes require
                   conceptualizing how different sequences of
                   transnational standardization relate to each other.

                   voluntary programs? Why and how do voluntary programs
                   on climate change sponsored by the state and federal
                   governments in the United States vary in their
                   institutional design? Scholars emphasize the
                   signaling role of voluntary programs to outside
                   stakeholders, and the excludable benefits that induce
                   firms to take on non-trivial costs of joining
                   voluntary programs. Scholars have noted several types
                   of benefits, particularly reputational benefits
                   programs provide, but have not systematically studied
                   why different programs emphasize different types of
                   benefits. We suggest that excludable benefits are
                   likely to take different forms depending on the
                   institutional context in which program sponsors
                   function. We hypothesize that federal programs are
                   likely to emphasize less tangible reputational
                   benefits while state programs are likely to emphasize
                   more tangible benefits, such as access to technical
                   knowledge and capital. Statistical analyses show the
                   odds of a voluntary program emphasizing tangible
                   benefits increases by several folds when the program
                   is sponsored by the state as opposed to federal
                   government. 1. Introduction Public law, often
                   termed as command and control, is the key pillar of
                   environmental governance across the world (Revesz
                   2001; Stavins 2004; Borck {\&} Coglianese 2009). In
                   recent years, new instruments have emerged to
                   supplement the extant regulatory mode. These include
                   information-based regulations (Toxics Release
                   Inventory), collaborative partnerships (watershed
                   partnerships), and market-based approaches (cap and
                   trade mechanisms).1 Importantly, Coglianese (2008)
                   notes a “managerial turn” in environmental policy
                   because regulators recognize that firms play a key
                   role in solving environmental problems and firms'
                   internal management needs to be shaped with this
                   objective in mind (Geiser 2001; Coglianese {\&} Nash
                   2006). One such managerial approach is voluntary
                   programs which impose obligations on participants
                   that are beyond the legal requirements (or where the
                   law is silent) to induce them to contribute to the
                   production of environmental public goods.2 Because
                   such efforts are expensive, in return for their
                   efforts, participants receive excludable benefits,
                   both tangible and non-tangible (Prakash {\&} Potoski
                   2006). Excludable benefits are membership benefits,
                   which actors sponsoring the voluntary programs
                   dispense in order to recruit participants. These
                   benefits are “excludable” to the extent that only
                   participants have access to them; this thwarts
                   free-riding by nonparticipants. Voluntary programs
                   have proliferated across issue areas (Coglianese {\&}
                   Nash 2001; Vogel 2005; Hsueh {\&} Prakash 2012) and
                   across the globe (Fiorino 1999; Morgenstern {\&}
                   Pizer 2007; Prakash {\&} Potoski 2012). For example,
                   voluntary programs for increasing energy efficiency
                   and curbing toxic chemical use have been established
                   in the US, Canada, France, Germany, Japan, and the
                   United Kingdom, among other industrialized countries
                   (Dietz {\&} Stern 2002; Price 2005; Morgenstern {\&}
                   Pizer 2007; Arimura et al. 2008; Hsueh 2012).
                   Importantly, these programs are sponsored by
                   supra-national structures such as the European
                   Commission, national and state governments,
                   nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), and trade
                   associations. The US Environmental Protection Agency
                   (EPA) has sponsored close to 100 programs while there
                   have been over 300 programs reported by the European
                   Environmental Agency, and 30,000 voluntary programs
                   in Japan (Morgenstern {\&} Pizer 2007).3 Scholars
                   have studied how voluntary programs emerge and
                   diffuse, and their efficacy. There is less work on
                   how the characteristics of the sponsoring actors and
                   their institutional environment influence program
                   design, specifically the forms in which programs
                   supply program benefits to their participants.
                   Indeed, much of the literature treats program design
                   as exogenous. Because program sponsors have different
                   attributes and function in different institutional
                   environments, we expect voluntary programs to vary in
                   their design, which has important consequences for
                   public policy. To test the link between sponsorship
                   and design, we examine voluntary programs in the
                   context of climate change mitigation, sponsored by US
                   regulators who are otherwise charged with enforcing
                   command and control regulation. To control for the
                   national context, we focus on the United States. The
                   US federal system offers an interesting context to
                   unpack the category of “regulators” into federal
                   and state regulators. This allows us to understand
                   their varying strengths and constraints regarding
                   program sponsorship. We believe the insights
                   developed in this paper regarding the link between
                   sponsorship and design should inform the discussions
                   on voluntary programs in other “federal” systems
                   including the European Union, its member countries,
                   and their regions.4},

  abstract =      {"Rethinking Private Authority examines the role of
                   non-state actors in global environmental politics,
                   arguing that a fuller understanding of their role
                   requires a new way of conceptualizing private
                   authority. Jessica Green identifies two distinct
                   forms of private authority--one in which states
                   delegate authority to private actors, and another in
                   which entrepreneurial actors generate their own
                   rules, persuading others to adopt them. Drawing on a
                   wealth of empirical evidence spanning a century of
                   environmental rule making, Green shows how the
                   delegation of authority to private actors has played
                   a small but consistent role in multilateral
                   environmental agreements over the past fifty years,
                   largely in the area of treaty implementation. This
                   contrasts with entrepreneurial authority, where most
                   private environmental rules have been created in the
                   past two decades. Green traces how this dynamic and
                   fast-growing form of private authority is becoming
                   increasingly common in areas ranging from organic
                   food to green building practices to sustainable
                   tourism. She persuasively argues that the
                   configuration of state preferences and the existing
                   institutional landscape are paramount to explaining
                   why private authority emerges and assumes the form
                   that it does. In-depth cases on climate change
                   provide evidence for her arguments. Groundbreaking in
                   scope, Rethinking Private Authority demonstrates that
                   authority in world politics is diffused across
                   multiple levels and diverse actors, and it offers a
                   more complete picture of how private actors are

  abstract =      {ABSTRACTCarbon markets are flourishing around the
                   globe, created both by governments and by nonstate
                   actors. In this article, I investigate when and why
                   governments choose to interact with and use private
                   rules about carbon offsets in public regulatory
                   arrangements. The analysis demonstrates that there is
                   “blurring” between public and private authority,
                   insofar that there are a multiple interactions
                   between the two spheres. However, a closer look
                   reveals that most of these are of a relatively weak
                   nature, since private standards are used for
                   voluntary rather than compliance purposes. To explain
                   this trend, I use qualitative and quantitative
                   analysis and find that NGOs are the main catalysts
                   for the interaction between public and private rules.
                   States are most likely to interact with private
                   regulations when they have large numbers of NGOs
                   active within their borders. In short, private
                   authority is largely a complement to public
                   regulatory arrangements. While previous work that

                   which eco-label programs certify that products are
                   “green”: gradation—single programs offering
                   multiple certification standards (e.g., platinum,
                   gold, silver)—and competition—multiple programs
                   vying to certify to their respective standards. We
                   find that, depending on whether programs are
                   sponsored by industry, environmental groups, or a
                   government, they have strikingly different incentives
                   to grade or compete. Industry sponsors are
                   indifferent about both; environmentalist sponsors
                   optimally grade or compete with other
                   environmentalist sponsors only if consumer
                   preferences for green consumption are skewed in a
                   specific way; and government sponsors׳ decisions
                   depend on the relative importance of private vs.
                   public benefits generated by the green market. We
                   find also that it is no accident that green markets
                   frequently have an environmentalist program competing
                   with an industry one. For each of the cases examined,

  abstract =      {AbstractThe complex and globalized nature of many
                   industries has led to a global governance deficit
                   that has resulted in the rise of self-regulation by
                   private firms. Despite well-developed body of
                   literature, we know little about the interaction of
                   private regulation and public governance. The
                   questions this paper addresses are: How do private
                   self-regulatory programs either fill a vacuum of
                   regulation or complement existing regulatory
                   structures, and how do these programs support or
                   crowd out the development of government regulatory
                   programs? This paper addresses these questions by
                   developing case studies of internal audit, voluntary
                   reporting, and data analysis programs operated by the
                   International Air Transport Association (IATA). The
                   results suggest that when there is a congruence of
                   goals between industry and government, private
                   regulatory programs can complement or even replace
                   existing public sector regulatory regimes.

                   performance of organizations, processes and products
                   is gaining prominence in market and policy arenas,
                   and thus, increasingly influencing sustainability
                   outcomes. This study presents a concept of rival
                   private governance where multiple initiatives compete
                   for rule-setting authority. Specifically, we argue
                   that heterogeneous actors organize in network form to
                   establish legitimacy of new sustainability governance
                   fields. In an effort to preempt threats from these
                   new fields of governance, nonparticipating actors
                   create rival private governance networks and compete
                   based on each network's ability to access unique
                   relational assets from participants. Based on the
                   cases of carbon off-set standards, green building
                   rating systems and sustainable forestry
                   certifications, we suggest that this competitive
                   market vetting results in pressures toward the
                   convergence of governance rules over time, but not a
                   single winning set of rules. Our findings illustrate
                   that multiple and competing networks can provide
                   innovative, legitimate and dynamically evolving
                   governance of sustainability, while presenting new
                   challenges for public and private sector actors.},

                   competition has negative consequences for the
                   effective functioning of these arrangements. In the
                   literature up until now, optimism prevails on how a
                   process of policy convergence between organizations
                   may come about that would solve some of the problems
                   that arise because of this competition. It is
                   remarkable, however, that in one of the key
                   industries referred to in this literature, the
                   garments industry, convergence is virtually absent.
                   This article explains why this is so and suggests
                   that next to three existing approaches to the
                   evolution and possible convergence of private
                   governance organizations, actually a fourth,
                   pessimistic type should be introduced, taking into
                   account the evolution and perseverance of political
                   difference between interest groups creating and
                   supporting private governance arrangements.},

                   certification (eco-labeling) is likely to rectify
                   certain omissions in the current global forest
                   regime. Following an examination of the achievements
                   and shortcomings of the forest regime to date, I
                   argue that gaps could be filled by including a broad
                   range of stakeholders in certification standards
                   development; promoting strong environmental and
                   social performance standards in forestry; providing
                   effective control mechanisms; securing producer
                   participation; and penetrating markets. Although the
                   Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) was considered
                   initially to have the greatest potential to fill
                   these gaps, the emergence and widespread
                   proliferation of industry-dominated schemes have
                   marginalized the FSC in many countries. The study
                   shows that while forest certification would probably
                   promote more sustainable forestry in the temperate
                   and boreal zones than it would in the tropical zone,
                   the ability of this tool to actually do so remains to
                   be seen.},

                   and governments toward labor and social issues at the
                   global level has fundamentally changed. Industrial
                   relations are rapidly internationalizing by
                   developing new actors and forms of governance to deal
                   with the regulation of labor. This article looks at
                   the evolution of self-regulatory standards in the
                   global labor governance debate. Key is that
                   notwithstanding problems with the lacking legal
                   framework of global regulation and enforceability,
                   patterns of local self-regulation, norm-setting, and
                   international codes lead not only to higher
                   expectations of the behavior of transnationally
                   operating firms but also to an indirect pattern of
                   regulation. The article argues that particularly the
                   adoption of the core labor standards by the
                   International Labour Organization (ILO) and the setup
                   of the Global Compact by the UN serve as points of
                   convergence. A plethora of voluntarist initiatives
                   that converge over time toward a shared understanding
                   of labor standards is part of the transformation of

                   firms labels for sustain- ability quality and firms
                   compete to sell consumers differentiated products. We

                   Moreover, competition between these two types NGOs

                   organizations (NGOs) to certify prosocial attributes
                   embodied in their products. We provide a model of
                   competition between NGOs in the provision of labeling
                   services. Competition between a fixed number of NGOs
                   features a “race to the top” in labeling
                   standards, but entry of NGOs offering new labels
                   pushes standards down. In a wide range of settings
                   NGO entry and competition results in too many labels
                   being adopted, with each label being too stringent.
                   Compared to a setting in which firms can credibly
                   communicate the social attributes of their products,
                   labels demand greater prosocial behavior than is
                   desired by firms, although with proliferation of the
                   number of labels this discrepancy disappears. In
                   contrast to existing models, firms may engage in
                   excessive corporate social responsibility when they
                   rely on an NGO as a certifying intermediary. This

                   system under the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC)
                   since it was initiated in 1993, and developed a new
                   state-sponsored Mexican Forest Certification System
                   (MFCS) that began in 2008. Several analyses have been
                   made of FSC forest certification in Mexico, but none
                   have summarized the new MFCS system or compared its

                   the non-state FSC market forest certification with
                   the state-sponsored MFCS system in Mexico, and review

                   to 900,388 ha for the more-established FSC program.
                   MFCS can be acceptable for stand-alone forest
                   certification, and might be viewed as a stepwise path
                   to FSC certification. The merits of both systems are

                   received forest management certification under the
                   Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) in the United States
                   and Sustainable Forestry Initiative (SFI) in the
                   United States and Canada to determine if forest
                   certification has changed forest management practices
                   and if the changes are practically and statistically
                   different between systems. The results indicate that
                   forest certification prompted substantial changes in
                   practices. On average, firms implemented 13‐14
                   changes in forestry, environmental, social, and
                   economic/system practices to obtain or maintain
                   forest certification. Although there was no
                   statistical difference between systems in the total
                   number of changes, there were many differences in the
                   implementation of specific forest practices, with FSC
                   firms required to make more environmental/forest
                   management changes and SFI firms required to make
                   more economic/system changes. Forest managers
                   believed that the benefits of forest certification
                   were greater than the disadvantages. SFI managers
                   rated the benefits of forest certification higher
                   than FSC managers, but also rated the disadvantages
                   higher. Most organizations felt certification
                   accomplished their objectives and were likely to
                   recertify, thus indicating their endorsement of the
                   process.},

                   performance. Voluntary programs can be conceptualized
                   as club goods that provide nonrival but potentially

                   important nongovernmental voluntary program, improves

                   broad positive standing with external audiences
                   provides a reputational benefit that helps induce

                   While the enhancing perspective suggests that

                   the association between strategic orientation and

                   German energy sector firms to identify which
                   perspective holds greater explanatory power.
                   Surprisingly, the empirical findings go beyond the
                   arguments made in the buffering perspective: high
                   perceived regulatory stakeholder pressure not only
                   weakens but also eradicates the relationship between

  abstract =      {Forest certification involves the labeling of certain
                   forest practices as responsible or sustainable based
                   on a set of environmental, economic and social
                   standards for “good forestry”. As such, it treads
                   within a normative arena previously reserved for
                   government, i.e. the establishment and enforcement of
                   acceptable rules of forest practice. Unlike
                   governments, however, no single certification system
                   can lay claim to ultimate authority. Instead,
                   competing certification systems have developed. On
                   one side is the Forest Stewardship Council, which is
                   strongly backed by major international environmental
                   groups. On the other, are industry-backed systems
                   such as the Canadian Standards Association and the
                   US-based Sustainable Forestry Initiative. Even within
                   a single certification system, such as the FSC,
                   differences have emerged between regional- level
                   standards, highlighting complex and often
                   controversial environmental, economic and/or social
                   dynamics. The act of comparing certification
                   standards, therefore, can be seen as a politically
                   reflexive act serving to highlight similarities or
                   differences in such a way as to enhance the
                   legitimacy of any given certification standard. In
                   fact, comparisons to date range from those finding
                   little significant difference between certification
                   standards to those declaring that only FSC standards,
                   or perhaps only a particular FSC regional standard,
                   approaches a credible measure of good forestry. This
                   article presents a new and complementary methodology
                   involving the systematic and analytical comparison of
                   1) the policy approach of different forest
                   certification standards and 2) the difference between
                   certification standards and underlying government
                   regulations. The findings reveal clear differences
                   between FSC regional standards in the US and Canada,
                   as well as between the FSC, CSA and SFI certification
                   systems, in regards to one key policy indicator: i.e.
                   protection of riparian zones. The FSC British
                   Columbian standards include the largest buffer zone
                   requirements but are less prescriptive than those of
                   the FSC Pacific Coast. The FSC Southeast standards
                   are comparable to the SFI standards, while the CSA
                   standards are the least restrictive. Comparison with
                   government requirements shows a striking isomorphism
                   between FSC regional standards and government
                   requirements, whereby the certification standards in
                   each region mimic the policy approach of government
                   regulations in that region while providing
                   incrementally more demanding substantive
                   requirements. The SFI national standards reflect a
                   mild increase in policy restrictiveness over
                   government standards in the US Southeast and no
                   significant change elsewhere. Finally, the CSA
                   standards provide no substantive requirements in
                   addition to government standards. The authors in no
                   way claim that the methodology presented here is the
                   only “legitimate” method for comparing standards.
                   Nevertheless, it does represent a relatively
                   systematic, replicable and transparent methodology
                   for identifying similarities and differences between
                   certification standards that are of considerable
                   importance to a wide variety of forest stakeholders.},

                   in the forestry sector over the past decade. These
                   'forest certification' programmes set global
                   standards for proper forest management and apply them
                   through institutionalized licensing and inspection
                   programmes. Similar programmes are appearing in other
                   sectors. Developed largely by environmental NGOs and
                   industry associations rather than governments, forest
                   certification programmes are nominally voluntary, but
                   are becoming increasingly mandatory in practice. They
                   are also gradually linking with government regulatory
                   and management programmes in various ways, while
                   remaining in tension both with each other and with
                   government programmes. The overall regulatory system
                   is thus highly dynamic, as the programmes compete
                   with each other for business and also with government
                   regulatory programmes for public acceptance. This
                   paper describes and assesses the administrative law
                   – i.e., the requirements for rule-making and rule
                   application – of the emerging global forest
                   regulatory system. It finds that while the

                   dynamics, including those of Baumgartner and Jones,
                   Sabatier and Jenkins-Smith, and Hall, is that policy
                   change occurs through a homeostatic process.
                   “Perturbations” occurring outside of an
                   institutionalized policy subsystem, often
                   characterized as some type of societal or political
                   upheaval or learning, are critical for explaining the
                   development of profound and durable policy changes
                   which are otherwise limited by ‘endogenous'
                   institutional stability. These homeostatic
                   assumptions, while useful for assessing many cases of
                   policy change do not adequately capture the
                   historical patterns of policy development found in
                   many sectors. The roots of this problem are traced
                   back to the origins of the new orthodoxy in
                   comparative policy research whereby different levels
                   (orders) of policymaking have been incorrectly
                   juxtaposed, providing a parsimonious, but sometimes
                   empirically incorrect, view of policy change.
                   Revising existing taxonomies of policy levels
                   provides a superior identification of the processes
                   of change, and uncovers more than one mechanism
                   through which significant policy change can occur.
                   Three of these alternative mechanisms - a
                   “neo-homeostatic” one in which paradigmatic
                   changes occur through endogenous shifts in goals; a
                   ‘quasi-homeostatic' in which exogenous factors
                   influence changes in objectives and settings; and a
                   ‘thermostatic' one in which durable policy
                   objectives require that settings adapt to exogenous
                   changes - are discussed.},
